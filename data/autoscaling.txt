AWS Auto Scaling automatically adjusts compute capacity to maintain performance and optimize cost.
It works with EC2 Auto Scaling groups and scaling policies such as target tracking, step scaling, and scheduled scaling.
CloudWatch metrics trigger scaling actions based on CPU utilization, request count, or custom metrics.
Best practices include using multiple Availability Zones, setting health checks, and defining scaling cooldown periods.
